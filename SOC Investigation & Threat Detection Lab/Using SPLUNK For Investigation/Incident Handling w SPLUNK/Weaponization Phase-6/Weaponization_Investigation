#  Weaponization Phase – OSINT & Adversary Infrastructure Analysis

---

##  Phase Objective

In the **Weaponization phase**, attackers prepare resources required to launch and sustain the attack.

This includes:
- Creating malware or payloads
- Registering look-alike domains (typosquatting)
- Setting up Command & Control infrastructure
- Preparing phishing or malicious delivery mechanisms

During the investigation of the `imreallynotbatman.com` compromise, we identified attacker infrastructure that warranted further **OSINT enrichment**.

##  Known Malicious Infrastructure

| Type | Value |
|------|------|
| C2 Domain | prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com |
| Attacker IP | 23.22.63.114 |

---

##  Step 1 — Threat Intelligence Lookup (Robtex)

**Tool Used:** Robtex  
**Reference:** https://www.robtex.com/ip-lookup/23.22.63.114  

###  Purpose
- Identify domains hosted on attacker IP
- Discover attacker infrastructure reuse
- Detect typosquatting domains targeting Wayne Enterprises

###  Findings
Robtex revealed multiple domains hosted on the same IP that closely resemble the Wayne Enterprises brand.

This indicates:
- Infrastructure reuse by attacker
- Pre-staged phishing / deception domains
- Possible multi-stage attack campaign

---

##  Step 2 — VirusTotal Infrastructure Analysis

**Tool Used:** VirusTotal  

###  Purpose
- Identify domain relationships
- Correlate attacker IP with additional malicious domains
- Expand threat intelligence context

###  Findings
Under the **Relations** tab for IP `23.22.63.114`, a suspicious typosquatting domain was discovered:

```
www.po1s0n1vy.com
```

This domain:
- Mimics Poison Ivy reference used in defacement artifact
- Suggests attacker branding/theme
- Indicates phishing or payload delivery infrastructure

##  Step 3 — WHOIS Analysis

**Tool Used:** DomainTools WHOIS  
**Reference:** https://whois.domaintools.com  

###  Purpose
- Identify registration patterns
- Discover attacker identity indicators
- Correlate domains via registrar, email, or nameserver reuse

###  Expected Intelligence
WHOIS data can reveal:
- Domain registration email reuse
- Registrar and hosting provider patterns
- Domain creation timeline
- Potential attribution clues

##  MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic | Technique | ID |
|-------|-----------|----|
| Resource Development | Acquire Infrastructure | T1583 |
| Resource Development | Domain Registration | T1583.001 |
| Resource Development | Compromise Infrastructure | T1584 |
| Command & Control | Dynamic Resolution | T1568 |
| Initial Access | Phishing via Look-alike Domains | T1566 |

## Lessons Learned

- Attackers often reuse IP infrastructure across multiple campaigns
- Typosquatting domains are strong indicators of phishing preparation
- OSINT enrichment strengthens attribution and detection capabilities
- VirusTotal Relations tab is powerful for infrastructure mapping
- WHOIS pivoting can uncover hidden attacker patterns

---

##  Detection & Prevention Improvements

- Monitor look-alike domain registrations for brand impersonation
- Integrate threat intelligence feeds into SIEM
- Block known malicious IP infrastructure proactively
- Implement domain monitoring for typosquatting detection
- Use passive DNS telemetry for attacker infrastructure tracking
- Automate OSINT enrichment during SOC investigations
